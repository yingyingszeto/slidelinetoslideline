OFFICIAL RULES</strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS CONTEST IS OPEN TO CANADIAN RESIDENTS AND IS GOVERNED BY CANADIAN LAW. NO PURCHASE IS NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. A PURCHASE DOES NOT INCREASE THE CHANCES OF WINNING. </strong></p>
<p>By taking part in this Contest you accept and agree to be legally bound by these Contest official rules (“Official Rules”) and agree that all decisions of Sponsor (as defined below) are final and binding. These Official Rules apply only to this Contest and not to any other promotions, contests, or sweepstakes sponsored by New Era (as defined below). The Official Rules are available at participating Lids Stores during normal business hours from August 28, 2018 until October 6, 2018, and at<u>www.sidelinetosideline.ca </u>throughout the Contest Period (as defined below).</p>
<p><strong>SPONSOR: </strong>This Contest is sponsored by New Era Cap Company, 6205A Airport Road, Suite 102, Mississauga, Ontario L4V 1E1 (“New Era” or “Sponsor”).</p>
<p><strong>CONTEST PERIOD: </strong>The “NEW ERA SIDELINE TO SIDELINE CONTEST” (the “Contest”) begins at 9:00 a.m. ET on August 28, 2018 and ends at 11:59 p.m. ET on October 6, 2018 (the “Contest Period”).</p>
<p><strong>ELIGIBILITY, RESIDENCY AND AGE:</strong>The Contest is only open to legal residents of Canada who are twenty-one (21) years of age or older as of the date they entered the Contest during the Contest Period (“Entrant” or “Entrants”). Despite the foregoing, employees, officers, directors of the Sponsors, NFL Entities (as defined below), representatives and/or agents (as well as their respective immediate family members [i.e. husband, wife, spouse, partner, mother, father, brothers, sisters, sons and/or daughters, regardless of where they live], and anyone domiciled with them whether related to them or not) of the Sponsor, and its parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies and/or any other entity involved in the administration, execution or fulfillment of the Contest (collectively, “Contest Parties”) are not eligible to enter the Contest or win the Prize (as defined below). Sponsor reserves the right to verify the eligibility of any Entrant at any time. The Contest is subject to all federal, provincial, territorial and municipal laws and regulations and is void where prohibited by law.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO RECEIVE A PIN CODE: </strong>At the start of the Contest Period, a total of 25,000 unique Contest PIN codes (a “PIN Code”) will be available for distribution in accordance with these Official Rules. There are three (3) ways to receive a PIN Code, respectively as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><u>Eligible Purchase</u>: To receive a PIN Code via eligible purchase (while supplies last), an Entrant must visit: (i) a participating Lids Retail Store (a list of the participating Lids Retail Stores is provided in Schedule A of the Official Rules) during its regular business hours during the Contest Period and purchase one (1) of the five (5) types of eligible Sideline Hats by New Era (a list of the types of eligible Sideline Hats by New Era is provided in Schedule B of the Official Rules) (while supplies last) (each, an “Eligible Hat”) (an “Eligible In-Store Purchase”); or (ii) <a href="http://www.lids.ca/">lids.ca</a>during the Contest Period and purchase an Eligible Hat (while supplies last) (an “Eligible Online Purchase”) (collectively, Eligible In-Store Purchase and Eligible Online Purchase will be referred to as “Eligible Purchases”). If an Entrant completes an Eligible Purchase during the Contest Period (as determined by the Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion), he/she will be eligible to receive one (1) PIN Code, while supplies last. For greater certainty, the Entrant will receive one (1) PIN Code per Eligible Hat purchased as part of an Eligible Purchase (while supplies last).</li>
<li><u>Email-in Request (NO PURCHASE NECESSARY)</u>: To obtain a PIN Code without having to complete an Eligible Purchase, an Entrant must compose an email that clearly states his/her full name, full mailing address (including postal code), daytime phone number, age and include an original, written essay (maximum 500 words, minimum 10 words), answering the following question “<em>Why do you deserve to go to an NFL Game?</em>” and send this email to<u>contest@sidelinetosideline.ca </u>(collectively, an “Email-in Request”). If an eligible Email-in Request is received in accordance with these Official Rules (as determined by the Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion), the applicable Entrant that submitted such Email-in Request will be provided with one (1) PIN Code (while supplies last). There is no limit to the number of Email-in Requests that may be submitted by an Entrant; however, each Email-in Request must be emailed in separate emails (i.e. mass Email-in Requests in the same email message will be void).</li>
<li><u>Social Media Post Drawing (NO PURCHASE NECESSARY</u>): To be eligible for the chance to win a PIN code via social media, participants must (i) have an active, valid and public Twitter or Instagram account, (ii) post a photo on either Instagram or Twitter of themselves wearing a 2018 New Era NFL Sideline Cap, and (iii) tag @Neweracanada and @lidscanada and hashtag #SidelinetoSideline in the social media post (collectively, each a “Valid Social Media Post”). By fully completing and submitting a Valid Social Media Post, participants will be eligible to win a PIN code from Sponsor. In Sponsor’s sole and complete discretion, and while supplies last, Sponsor will randomly select one PIN code winner daily at 11:59 p.m from all Valid Social Media Posts submitted during the Contest Period. Participants are solely responsible for Internet connectivity, software and/or hardware that may be required in order to create and/or submit any Valid Social Media Post. Incomplete and/or inaccurate posts are void. Limit one (1) Valid Social Media Post per person and/or Instagram/ Twitter account. In case of multiple Valid Social Media Posts received from any person or Instagram/Twitter account, only the first Valid Social Media Post received from such person or Instagram/Twitter account will be considered. Any post that does not comply with these Official Rules will be void, eliminated and not eligible for consideration in Sponsor’s randomly-selected PIN code drawing.  Each daily PIN code drawing winner will be provided with one (1) PIN code (while supplies last), and notified by a New Era representative via direct message on Instagram or Twitter, as applicable.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>HOW TO ENTER: </strong>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. Once you’ve received a PIN Code, to enter go to <a href="http://www.sidelinetosideline.ca/">www.sidelinetosideline.ca</a>(the “Website”), follow the on-screen instructions to obtain the Official Contest Entry Form (the “Entry Form”), fully complete the Entry Form with all required information, which may include a requirement to: (i) enter your first name, last name, email address, date of birth, mobile telephone number, full mailing address (including street address, city, province, postal code); (ii) enter your PIN Code; (iii) select a city (from among the list of cities provided) where you would like to attend an NFL Game (if you are selected as the Prize winner) (a “Selected City”); and (iv) signify your agreement that you have read and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these Official Rules. Once you have fully completed the Entry Form with all required information and have agreed to the Official Rules, follow the on-screen instructions to submit your completed Entry Form (a “Main Entry”). To be eligible, your Main Entry must be submitted and received in accordance with these Official Rules during the Contest Period (as determined by the Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion on the basis of its official records). Further, after you’ve submitted a Main Entry, you will have the option (and, for greater certainty, are not required) to follow the on-screen instructions to share a Contest tweet on Twitter during the Contest Period (a “Bonus Entry”) (collectively, Main Entries and Bonus Entries will be referred to as “Entries”). There is a limit of one (1) Bonus Entry per person per Day (where a “Day” is defined as beginning at 12:00:01 a.m. ET and ending at 11:59:59 p.m. ET).</p>
<p><strong>LIMITS AND VERIFICATION: </strong>Each PIN Code is unique and can only be submitted one (1) time in the Contest. Each PIN Code will automatically expire after its first use or at the end of the Contest Period (whichever occurs first). Please retain the original PIN Code for your records. All PIN Codes submitted are subject to verification in the sole and absolute discretion of the Sponsor. Any PIN Code that cannot be verified to the complete satisfaction of the Sponsor, in its sole and absolute discretion, is subject to immediate disqualification (in which case the corresponding Main Entry and any Bonus Entry will also be disqualified). If it is discovered by the Sponsor (using any evidence or other information made available to or otherwise discovered by the Sponsor) that any person has attempted to: (i) exceed any of the limits stated in these Official Rules; and/or (ii) use multiple names, identities, email addresses, accounts, and/or any automated, macro, script, robotic or other system(s) or program(s) to enter or otherwise participate in or to disrupt this Contest (including without limitation submit PIN Codes); (iii) falsely enter a PIN Code without obtaining a PIN Code in accordance with these Official Rules; (iv) re-enter a PIN Code a subsequent time after its first use; and/or (v) enter a PIN Code that has been falsified, manipulated or otherwise altered in any way (all as determined by Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion); then he/she may be disqualified from the Contest in the sole and absolute discretion of the Sponsor. The Released Parties (defined below) are not responsible for late, lost, misdirected, delayed, incomplete, illegible or incompatible Eligible Purchases, Email-in Requests, Valid Social Media Posts, Entry Forms, Entries and/or PIN Codes (all of which are void).</p>

<tr>
<td width="356"><strong>Criteria</strong></td>
<td width="112"><strong>Weighting</strong></td>
